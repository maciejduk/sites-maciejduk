I'm excited to share that I've successfully passed the **Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)** examination!

## What is RHCE?

The RHCE certification validates advanced skills in Red Hat Enterprise Linux system administration, including:

- Automating system administration tasks with Ansible
- Managing system services and processes

- Implementing security practices

## The Journey

The preparation involved hands-on practice with:

This certification builds upon my RHCSA and demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning in the Linux ecosystem.
